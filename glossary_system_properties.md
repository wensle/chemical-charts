# Thermodynamic Property Glossary

This documentation page provides a brief explanation of some common thermodynamic properties and model parameters used in the context of the `pycalphad` library. Please note, not all the terms listed here are standard or directly used in `pycalphad` as of the latest knowledge cutoff in September 2021.

## Property Definitions

**`BMAG`**: Not a standard thermodynamic property. Could potentially refer to magnetic field (B field), but exact interpretation is context-dependent.

**`CPM`**: Stands for heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) on a molar basis. It quantifies the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance by one degree at constant pressure.

**`CPM_MIX`**: Could potentially refer to a mixture-averaged or composition-dependent molar heat capacity at constant pressure.

**`DOO`**: Not a standard abbreviation in thermodynamics. Could be a specific model parameter or variable. Its meaning is context-dependent.

**`G`**: Typically stands for Gibbs free energy, a crucial thermodynamic property that describes the "useful" or process-initiating work obtainable from a system at constant temperature and pressure.

**`GM`**: Could refer to molar Gibbs free energy, which is the Gibbs free energy per mole of substance.

**`GM_MIX`**: Could potentially refer to a mixture-averaged or composition-dependent molar Gibbs free energy.

**`HM`**: Often denotes molar enthalpy (H), which is the total energy of a thermodynamic system per mole of substance.

**`HM_MIX`**: Could potentially refer to a mixture-averaged or composition-dependent molar enthalpy.

**`NT`**: Not a standard thermodynamic property. Could be a specific model parameter or variable. Its meaning is context-dependent.

**`SM`**: Generally denotes molar entropy (S), a measure of the number of specific ways a system may be arranged, typically understood as a measure of disorder.

**`SM_MIX`**: Could potentially refer to a mixture-averaged or composition-dependent molar entropy.

**`TC`**: Could stand for critical temperature, transition temperature, or a similar concept, but the precise interpretation is context-dependent.

For authoritative and up-to-date definitions, always refer to the documentation or other explanatory materials associated with the specific model or data you are working with.

## Using `pycalphad`

`pycalphad` is a Python library for designing and manipulating thermodynamic models and calculating thermodynamic properties. It does not directly use some of the terms listed above, but it does provide robust functionality for calculating thermodynamic properties across phases and compositions, given an appropriate thermodynamic model.

To get started with `pycalphad`, refer to the official [pycalphad documentation](http://pycalphad.org/docs/latest/).
